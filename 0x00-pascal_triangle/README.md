# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle
<p style="font-size:16px;">This repository contains an implementation of Pascal's Triangle in the Pascal programming language. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that consists of triangular numbers arranged in a triangular pattern. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.</p>

## Task
