# 0x08. Making Change
***Algorithm Python***
Welcome to the 0x08. Making Change project! This project is designed to solve the problem of determining the fewest number of coins needed to make a given total amount using a set of coins with different values.

- Given a pile of coins of different values and a target amount, the objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to meet the target amount. If the target amount cannot be achieved using the given coins, the program will return -1.

```
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
If total is 0 or less, return 0
If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
